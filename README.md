## Reinvention through code
Through pasion and resilience I aim to reinvent myself through code and create solutions helpful to Africa, Women in Africa and the entire World.
## The genesis
* Command prompt in ununtu
* git - hectic but survived
* html - easy peasy
* README - well we are here now
{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? Do I need to install any dependencies? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this app depends on?}
## HICCUPS
None
## Technologies Used
*HTML
*Many more to come.
