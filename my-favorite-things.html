            <li>
        <p>Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens
            Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens
            Brown paper packages tied up with strings
            These are a few of my favorite things</p> 
            </li>
            <li>
        <p>Cream-colored ponies and crisp apple strudels;
            Doorbells and sleigh bells and schnitzel with noodles;
            Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings;
            These are a few of my favorite things.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
        <p>Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes
            Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes
            Silver-white winters that melt into springs
            These are a few of my favorite things</p>
            </li>
            <li>
        <p>When the dog bites,
            When the bee stings,
            When I'm feeling sad,
            I simply remember my favorite things,
            And then I don't feel so bad.</p>
