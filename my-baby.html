                    I have <strong><em>two</em> babies</strong>:
                    <ul>
                        <li> one is very old - <em>born in 1995</em></li>
                        <li>one is very young - <em>barely half a year</em></li>
                    </ul>
                </p> 
                 <p>They are both boys. </p>

        <h2><strong>The Big One</strong></h2>
        <span class="baby1">
                <p>The one from 1995 is unique, he is the love of my life. 
                <ul>
                    <li>  He lifts me up when I am down.</li>
                    <li>  He picks me up when I have fallen. </li>
                    <li>  Cheers me up when I am sad. </li>
                    <li> Knows how to throw down a great meal </li>
                    <li> and most importantly, gives me a good laugh </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Sometimes, he can be very difficult to understand or be with.
                    I still pray to God that he is the one for me,
                    since I enjoy his company more than anyone else.

        <h2><strong>The not so tiny one <em>yet</em> so tiny</strong></h2>
        <span class="baby2">
            <p>This one came to me as a surprise. 
                Actually when I had accumulated enough money to by a sportsbike.
                Little did I know that money would be used for diapers</p>
            <p>I must admit this baby is a handful, but I cannot even imagine a life without him
